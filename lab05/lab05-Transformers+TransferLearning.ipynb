        "# Lab 05 - Transformers\n",
        "The lab is adopted from the [popular PyTorch sentiment analysis tutorial by bentrevett](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/6%20-%20Transformers%20for%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we will be using the transformer model, first introduced in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. Specifically, we will be using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformer models are considerably larger than anything else covered so far in the module. As such we are going to use the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) to `get pre-trained transformers and use them as our embedding layers`. We will freeze (not train) the transformer and only train a remainder of the model which learns from the representations produced by our frozen pre-trained Transformer. In this lab, we will be using a multi-layer Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), however any neural network (MLP/LSTM/...) can learn from these representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, it's important to note that transformer models like BERT come with their own pre-trained tokenizers. Since the pre-training process has already used a tokenizer to format the data prior to model input, you must utilize the same tokenizer designed to work seamlessly with it's respective model, ensuring that the text input is appropriately formatted. This includes tokenizing the text into tokens understood by the model, adding necessary special tokens, and converting these tokens into their corresponding ID numbers from the model's vocabulary, which is also a crucial part of our learning in this lab. As a result, we do not need to perform manual tokenization or vocabulary mapping steps, which significantly simplifies the preprocessing pipeline. By leveraging these integrated tokenizers, we ensure that our text data is processed in a manner that is fully compatible with the transformer model's requirements, allowing us to focus on fine-tuning the model for our specific task - `sentiment analysis`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, BERT in an autoencoder stacked with up to 12 encoder layers as shown to you in the vanilla Transformers architecture. Different transformer models (like many popular decoder models - GPT/Llama/DeepSeek) utilize distinct tokenizers tailored to their architecture and training paradigms. For instance, models such as LLaMA (https://medium.com/@vyperius117/understanding-the-llama2-tokenizer-working-with-the-tokenizer-locally-using-transformers-2e0f9e69d786), GPT-4(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&si=qXbrvMZSqPlwdKT6), and Mistral(https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/mistral/mistral_tokenizer/) each come with their specialized tokenizers. One notable tokenizer that is widely used across various models is the SentencePiece tokenizer. Unlike traditional tokenizers that operate on the word level and may struggle with languages without clear word boundaries, SentencePiece tokenizes text at the subword level. This approach allows for a more flexible handling of unknown words, better preservation of linguistic information, and improved model performance across diverse languages. SentencePiece does not rely on pre-tokenization and works directly on the raw text, making it highly versatile and effective for a wide range of NLP tasks."

            "(1, 'I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.')\n"
